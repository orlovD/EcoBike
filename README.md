# ecobike
EcoBike is an innovative player in the market of short-distance transportation solutions. They are
expanding their business from a traditional shop to a worldwide presence on the internet. To enable
that step, they are asking you to build a barebones software system to help them enable that transition.
As they are aware that within the time you are given you can only design a prototype application, they
are asking you to focus on their 3 core products, namely: folding bikes, electric bikes and so-called
speedelecs, high-speed fully electric bikes. There is a clear aim to expand their online product portfolio
in the short term, so do take that into consideration when designing your software system!
